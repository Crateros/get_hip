Spit fire with Urban Dictionary API. This application allows a user to get definitions and similar slang terms for a word or sentence and copy it to a clipboard. You can then send it off in a text, tweet, whatever you like. This application was built for a company wide 24 hour hackathon at General Assembly and utilizes the AngularJS framework. The live site is here: https://spitfyre.herokuapp.com/. Our goal was to create a mobile friendly funny application that people can use on the go.

### Future Features

* Add a SFW / NSFW slider to filter or mask unsavory content.
* Add logic to detect when the API returns duplicate synonyms.
* Add a sound player to hear the slang pronunciation.
