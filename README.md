Spit fire with Urban Dictionary API. This application allows a user to get definitions and similar slang terms for a word or sentence and copy it to a clipboard. This application was built for a company wide 24 hour hackathon at General Assembly and utilizes the AngularJS framework. The live site is here: https://spitfyre.herokuapp.com/. Our goal was to create a mobile friendly funny application that people can use on the go.
